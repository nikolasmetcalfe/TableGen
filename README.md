# Sound Design Portfolio

Overview

I have an enormous love for DIY audio projects. The problem that I've run into showcasing work
is that the span of what I'm displaying is too wide to make sense in a traditional blog format.
Instead, I'd like to create a personal page that hosts audio files, links to Pure Data patches,
and showcases some hardware hacks that I've utilized in making noisy tunes. Users can log in
to access patch downloads and opt to receive updates when a new music-making tool is posted.
